# Milestone Floristry Website

In this project, I am to build a static front-end site to present useful information to users, using all the technologies that I have learned about so far.

For this project, I will be creating a lite and elegant website for a startup Floristry company that has been providing floral arrangements the past two years. The website will showcase the florists range of products and services for domestic and commercial customers as well as providing inspiration and advice.

## UX

The Website is for anyone that wants floral arrangements for the home special occation or as a gift. The website will also provide advice and information on seasonal flowers as well as aftercare, plus inspiration and design ideas for special events.

When you enter the website you will be greeted by a brief statement explaining the companies vision, there will be a sign up and sign in
