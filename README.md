# Milestone Floristry Website

In this project, I am to build a static front-end site to present useful information to users, using all the technologies that I have learned about so far.

For this project, I will be creating a lite and elegant website for a startup Floristry company that has been providing floral arrangements the past two years. The website will increase company profile and showcasing the florists range of products and services as well as providing inspiration and advice.

## UX

The Website is for anyone that wants floral arrangements for the home special occasion or as a gift. The website will also provide advice and information on seasonal flowers as well as aftercare, plus inspiration and design ideas for special events.

- As a user, I want to see past flower arrangements.
- As a user, I want to know of any special offers.
- As a user, I want to get quotes for flower arrangements.
- As a user, I want advice on flower arrangements.
- As a user, I want to be informed of money off deals.
- As a user, I want to know what flowers are in season.
- As a user, I want advice on flower arrangement aftercare.
